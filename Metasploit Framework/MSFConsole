Launch msfconsole using following command :
> msfconsole

Once launched, the command line changes to msf6 (or msf5 depending on the installed version of Metasploit). The Metasploit console (msfconsole) can be used just like a regular command-line shell, as you can see below. 

> ls - lists the contents of the folder from which Metasploit was launched using the msfconsole command.
> ping - ping the IP inside MSF, the ping process would continue until it is stopped using #CTRL+C
> clear - to clear the terminal screen

# MSFConsole support many Linux commands but does not support some features like output redirection.

MSFConsole Commands: 

> help - can be used on its own or for a specific command
> history - history of previously typed commands

An important feature of msfconsole is the support of 'TAB completion'. For example, if you start typing 'he' and press the 'TAB' key, you will see it auto-
completes to 'help'.

Msfconsole is managed by context; this means that unless set as a global variable, all parameter settings will be lost if you change the module you have 
decided to use. (eg. RHOSTS, LHOSTS, LPORTS set for one module remains in context with that module only).

> use [module name] - The module to be used be selected with the use command followed by the path/to/module_name of the module.
		      It can also be selected with the use command followed by the number at the beginning of the search result line.
	> use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
	> use 364

The prompt tells us we now have a context set in which we will work. 

> show options - This will print options related to the module we have chosen.

The show options command will have different outputs depending on the context it is used in.

The modules will require us to set variables like RHOSTS and RPORT (For exploits), SESSION ID (For Post-exploitation module)

> show [option]- can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. The example below 
lists 
payloads that can be used with the ms17-010 Eternalblue exploit.
	> show payloads

> info - detailed information on selected module (in curent context).
> info [path/to/module_name] - detailed information of any module from the msfconsole prompt.

> back - leave the context (module)

> search [parameter] - search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. 
	> search ms17-010
You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.), or target system.

You can use any module returned in a search result with the command 'use' followed by the number at the beginning of the result line.
	> use 0 instead of 'use auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command'

You can direct the search function using keywords such as type and platform.
	> search type:auxiliary telnet
	> search platform:windows smb


Rank column in Search results :

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK			DESCRIPTION
-------------------   	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent		The exploit will never crash the service. This is the case for SQL Injection, CMD execution, RFI, LFI, etc. No 
			typical memory corruption exploits should be given this ranking unless there are extraordinary circumstances

Great			The exploit has a default target AND either auto-detects the appropriate target or uses an application-specific 
			return address AFTER a version check.

Good			The exploit has a default target and it is the “common case” for this type of software (English, Windows 7 for 
			a desktop app, 2012 for server, etc). Exploit does not auto-detect the target.

Normal			The exploit is otherwise reliable, but depends on a specific version that is not the “common case” for this type 
			of software and can’t (or doesn’t) reliably autodetect.

Average			The exploit is generally unreliable or difficult to exploit, but has a success rate of 50% or more for common 
			platforms.

Low			The exploit is nearly impossible to exploit (under 50% success rate) for common platforms.

Manual			The exploit is unstable or difficult to exploit and is basically a DoS (15% success rate or lower). This ranking 
			is also used when the module has no use unless specifically configured by the user.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: Please remember that exploits take advantage of a vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking 
exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.
